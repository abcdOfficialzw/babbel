# Flutter UI Challenge 1

I decided to hone my Flutter UI skills and took it upon myself to find stunning application designs and try to recreate them as best as I can. It's a long journey but I feel with every design I recreate my skills in crafting beautiful designs increases too

## Design recreated
This recreation is from the application Babbel, a mobile application to learn to speek foreign languages. You can fin the designs on [dribble](https://mobbin.com/apps/babbel-ios-024a4727-2f5b-41ec-9a08-0779d4000244?utm_source=copy_link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=app_sharing)
